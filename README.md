# Carbon Emission Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes carbon emissions data to uncover trends, patterns, and potential insights. The objective is to explore the relationship between various factors and carbon emissions, leveraging data-driven techniques such as clustering and predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on carbon emissions, including various independent variables that may influence emission levels.

## Objectives
- Understand the distribution of carbon emissions across different regions and categories.
- Identify key factors contributing to carbon emissions.
- Apply clustering techniques to group similar entities while ensuring the 'category_id' column remains unscaled.
- Build predictive models to estimate carbon emissions based on input features.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (excluding 'category_id')
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations of key trends
   
3. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Applying clustering techniques while keeping 'category_id' unscaled
   - Evaluating cluster quality
   
4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Building machine learning models to predict 'view' as the dependent variable
   - Evaluating model performance

## Dependencies
To run the notebook successfully, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the `Carbon_emission.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Modify parameters or input data as needed for further exploration.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into carbon emission trends and factors influencing them. The clustering and predictive modeling approaches help in segmenting data and making informed predictions.
